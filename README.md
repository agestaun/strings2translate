# strings2translate ðŸ“‘
 Project to apply translated strings to json files for my company.

 It takes the strings from the source files and replaces them in the destination files.

## How do I run it?

#### Install ts-node if you don't have it already.
This will allow you to execute TypeScript code directly.
>npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'
#### Execute the index file using ts-node from the root directory
>ts-node index.ts
