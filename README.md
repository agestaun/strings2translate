# strings2translate ðŸ“‘
 Project to apply translated strings to json files for my company.

 It takes the strings from the source files and replaces them in the destination files.

## How do I run it?

#### Install ts-node if you don't have it already.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pay attention to the TODOs before running the code. Some paths need to be replaced to find the source and target files.

This will allow you to execute TypeScript code directly.
>npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'
#### Execute the index file using ts-node from the root directory
>ts-node index.ts
